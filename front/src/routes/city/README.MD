This is the city route.

Rather than setting up static pages, I went for dynamic. It seemed worth the time since it would've of taken a while to create individual pages for all the cities anyway. So the city pages make the call to the api using a slug (EX: oceanSprings). The api returns the information from the category - so title, description, and anything else we need to put in it.
