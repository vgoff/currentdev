This is the header/navigation.

This is pretty much done apart from some styling tweaks and a logo.

It currently is just static content put in (home, jobs, etc.) along with an api call to get the cities for the cities dropdown. If we start adding a lot of cities, I might need to change the dropdown to some sort of searchable dropdown.
