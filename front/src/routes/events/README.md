This is the route for the Events page.

index.js is the default file. It loads the top-level events component. It is also making two api calls right now. One call is for the events (along with all the filtering/searching options). The other call is to get all the cities (for filtering purposes).

Events.js is the top-level React component for the page (or the wrapper). It will then load the render component for the events page.

Events.css is the css (styling) code that is compiled with POSTCSS.
