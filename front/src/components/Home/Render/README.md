This is the homepage.

A good amount of work is needed on this. Currently all the data is static. I'll need to make an api call to get the latest events to put in a slider. Below that, I'll also need to setup an api call to get the list of things available in the city (jobs, events, hotels, etc.).

I also need to setup the search box and the filtering options on this page. That shouldn't be too difficult since I've already gotten most of the logic for that configured on other pages.
