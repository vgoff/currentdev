This is the route for the Golf Course page.

index.js is the default file. It loads the top-level golf course component. It is also making one api call right now. It calls for the info for the specific golf course. So if someone were to go to southms.com/golf-courses/6, then index.js would make the call to southms.com/index.php/api/golf-courses/6 to get all of the info for that specific golf course.
